# HTC-Simulator (Hyperbolic Time Chamber Simulator)

**An Actor-Based Discrete Event Simulator Using Scala and Akka**

Inspired by the legendary "Hyperbolic Time Chamber" from Dragon Ball, HTC-Simulator is a powerful discrete event simulator that leverages the power of actor-based programming with Scala and Akka.

## Current Features:

* **Simulation Time Management:** Precise control over the flow of time within the simulation.
* **Event Coordination:** Efficient orchestration of interactions between different entities (actors) in the simulation.

## Features Under Development:

* **Reporting:** Generation of detailed reports on simulation results.
* **Digital Twin:** Creation of digital replicas of real-world systems for simulation and analysis.
* **Dataflow:** Support for real-time data stream processing within the simulation.
* **Snapshot:** Ability to capture the simulation state at specific moments for later analysis or restoration.
* **Machine Learning:** Integration of machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis and decision-making within the simulation.

### Simulation Configuration:

To start a new simulation, you need to provide a JSON configuration file with the simulation details, including the name, description, start date, end date, time unit, and time step.

### Actor Data Sources

Each actor in the simulation is defined by a specific type and a corresponding data source. Actor data can be provided in different formats, such as JSON, XML, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.
**data/actor1.json:**
```json
[
    {
      "name": "Actor1",
      "type": "ActorType1",
      "data": {
        "type": "DataType1",
        "content": {
          "property1": 10,
          "property2": 20,
          "objectProperty": {
            "subProperty1": 30,
            "subProperty2": 40
          }
        }
      }
    }
]
```
**data/actor2.xml:**
```xml
<actors>
    <actor>
      <name>Actor1</name>
      <type>ActorType2</type>
      <data>
        <type>DataType2</type>
        <content>
          <property1>50</property1>
          <property2>60</property2>
          <objectProperty>
            <subProperty1>70</subProperty1>
            <subProperty2>80</subProperty2>
          </objectProperty>
        </content>
      </data>
    </actor>
</actors>
```
**data/actor3.json:**

```json
[
    {
      "name": "Actor1",
      "type": "ActorType3",
      "data": {
        "type": "Default",
        "content": {
          "property1": 10,
          "property2": 20,
          "objectProperty": {
            "subProperty1": 30,
            "subProperty2": 40
          }
        }
      }
    }
]
